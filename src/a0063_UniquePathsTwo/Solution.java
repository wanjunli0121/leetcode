/*
Follow up for "Unique Paths":
Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids.
How many unique paths would there be?
An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.
For example,
There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.
[
[0,0,0],
[0,1,0],
[0,0,0]
]
The total number of unique paths is 2.
Note: m and n will be at most 100.
